- getState() will simply read the game state from the database.
- update(state) will update the gameState in the database to a value passed to it inside the parentheses.
-> databaseReference.on() creates a listener which keeps listening to the gameState from the database.
Here the function is directly written inside the .on() listener.
-> databaseReference.update() will update the database reference. Here "/" refers to the main database inside which gameState is created.
start() function which will start the game and display on the screen depending on the state of the game.
